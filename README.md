## My HackerRank Work

Hi friends! This is a place for my work on HackerRank. For six months, I spent two hours every day learning Python and SQL. It was hard work but I learned so much. 

In this folder, you can see files with my solutions. The Python file has many problems I solved using Python language. The SQL file has database questions I answered with SQL.

I wrote comments in the code to explain what I did. My coding skills got better over time. You can see the changes in the "History" part. 

This was a big learning time for me. I struggled sometimes but kept working hard. I hope you can learn from my solutions too. Let me know if you have any questions!

Coding is fun when you understand after trying. I am happy to share my work with you all. Happy learning!
