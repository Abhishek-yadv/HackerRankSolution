# My HackerRank Work

### Hi friends, Welcome to my HackerRank Solution Repository!

🌱 This is a place for my work on HackerRank. For six months, I spent 4 hours every day learning Python and SQL and solving one problem.

🔍 Why 4 hours? Because I developed and approached one problem in many ways, not just one way. I explored multiple solutions and aimed for the most efficient manner. It was hard work, but I learned so much. 💪

🌟 The best part is here you will get to know how one problem can be solved in many ways and the most efficient manner. 🧠✨

📁 In this folder, you can see files with my solutions. I solved many problems with the Python file using the Python language. 🐍

🗄️ The SQL file has database questions I answered with SQL. 🗄️

💬 I wrote comments in the code to explain what I did. My coding skills got better over time. You can see the changes in the "History" part. 📈

🎓 This was a big learning time for me. I struggled sometimes but kept working hard.🔄

❓ I hope you can learn from my solutions too. Let me know if you have any questions!

⚡ Coding is fun when you understand after trying. I am happy to share my work with you all. Happy learning! 🎉
