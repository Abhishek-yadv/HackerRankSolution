# My HackerRank Work 🚀

### Hi friends, Welcome to my HackerRankSolution.

This is a place for my work on HackerRank. For six months, I spent two hours every day learning Python and SQL. It was hard work but I learned so much. 💪

The best part is here you will get to know how one problem you can solve in many ways and most efficient manner.

In this folder, you can see files with my solutions. The Python file has all the Python and sql problems I solved using Python language.🐍

The SQL file has database questions I answered with SQL. 🗄️

I wrote comments in the code to explain what I did. My coding skills got better over time. You can see the changes in the "History" part.📈

This was a big learning time for me. I struggled sometimes but kept working hard.🔄

I hope you can learn from my solutions too.

Let me know if you have any questions! ❓

Coding is fun when you understand after trying. I am happy to share my work with you all. Happy learning! 🎉
