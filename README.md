# My HackerRank Work 

### Hi friends, Welcome to my HackerRankSolution Repository!

This is a collection of my work on HackerRank. Over the past six months, I dedicated 4 hours daily to learning Python and SQL by solving **[Number] problems**.

Why 4 hours? I aimed to develop a deep understanding by approaching each problem from multiple angles, not just the first solution that came to mind. I explored various approaches and strived for the most efficient solutions. It was challenging, but incredibly rewarding. 

The best part? You'll see how a single problem can be solved in many ways, with some approaches being more efficient than others. ✨

This repository is organized into folders:

* **Python:** Contains all Python and SQL problems I solved using Python.
* **SQL:** Contains solutions to database questions using SQL. ️

The code includes comments explaining my thought process and approach. You'll also notice improvements in my coding style as you explore the "History" section. This journey was a tremendous learning experience. There were challenges, but I persevered and kept pushing myself. 

I hope my solutions can be a valuable learning resource for you. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions! ❓
