# My HackerRank Work 

### Hi friends, Welcome to my HackerRank Solution Repository!

This is a place for my work on HackerRank. For six months, I spent 4 hours every day learning Python and SQL and solving one problem.

Why 4 hours? Because I developed and approached one problem in many ways, not just one way. I explored multiple solutions and aimed for the most efficient manner. It was hard work, but I learned so much. 💪

The best part is here you will get to know how one problem can be solved in many ways and the most efficient manner. 🧠✨

In this folder, you can see files with my solutions. The Python file has many problems I solved using the Python language. 🐍

The SQL file has database questions I answered with SQL. 🗄️

I wrote comments in the code to explain what I did. My coding skills got better over time. You can see the changes in the "History" part. 📈

This was a big learning time for me. I struggled sometimes but kept working hard. 🔄

I hope you can learn from my solutions too. Let me know if you have any questions! ❓

Coding is fun when you understand after trying. I am happy to share my work with you all. Happy learning! 🎉
